## Step 0: Confusion Signal Validation Experiment

**Core Hypothesis to Test**

`"A model learning task A will produce measurably different internal signals when encountering task B that requires architectural changes vs. task B' that just needs parameter tuning" 
In other words:`

Addition → Multiplication = architectural confusion (needs new circuits)
Addition → Subtraction = parametric confusion (same circuits, different weights)
If we can't distinguish these, the whole framework collapses.
